            "Lucid Motors has earnings Nov 7th and on the same day it's highly anticipated Gravity SUV comes out for pre orders with earnings also coming after the bell. My aim with that is they will probably give us good feedback about how the orders are coming in on the call. I'm guessing pre orders will be a $100 fully refundable situation. I remember when Tesla did the same thing and the pre order numbers were insane and the stock blew up. The bar is set super low here. Lucid only makes like 9k cars a year. The expectations by the street are also super low and below company forecast expectations. Seeing as last month they had a large funding round at around $2.70 a share and now it's even trading at $2.20 (that means smart people bought it 20% higher than you will). The street is looking for literally anything from this company the bar has been set so low. It's over sold on the indicators and is very close to book value (meaning if you sold all of it's assets after paying off it's debt you would get a decent amount of money back in respects to the stock price). The street is looking for literally anything here to point to even a potential for profitability to bounce it back in the $4 range (that's 100% on your money currently) and yeah if the ev spark ignites again this could be a 10x stock easily. What's the downside? Limited AF, oversold, close to book value. They are also 62% owned by Saudia Arabia so again even a hint about a take over would send the stock skyrocketing as Saudia would have to pay a premium to own the shares. Only 40% float with 25% of that shorted. I've been seeing it on the chart and it usually goes up 1.5x the amount that Rivian does. I am literally throwing you the softest ball of your life to wack it with your regard bat. Don't mess this up.\n",
